'''
Create a function that takes both a string and an array of numbers as arguments. 
Rearrange the letters in the string to be in the order specified by the index numbers.
Return the "remixed" string.
Examples
remix("abcd", [0, 3, 1, 2]) âžž "acdb"
The string you'll be returning will have: "a" at index 0, "b" at index 3, "c" at index 1, "d" at index 2,
because the order of those characters maps to their corresponding numbers in the index array.'''

    j=0
    res=["*"]*len(s)
    print(res)
    for i in l:
        res[i]=s[j]
        j=j+1
    return "".join(res)
    '''k=""
    for i in l:
        k+=s[i]
    return k'''

s="abcd"
l=[0,3,1,2]
